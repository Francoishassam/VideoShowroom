# VideoShowroom

This Web Page is used to play Live and VOD ABR streams (HLS using HLS.js and MPEG-DASH using DASH.js players).

Streams provided in the choice list are hosted on AWS through Cloudfront CDN.

Mediatailor is also used to perform SSAI based on SCTE35 markers for some streams, and VMAP + Cue points on other streams.

User can use the manual input field to load its own ABR stream (only HLS or DASH).

This site shall not be used or copied by anyone without consent of owner. 

None of the ABR streams avaiable in the choice list shall be used without the consent of the owner.
